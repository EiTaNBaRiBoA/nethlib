Multiplayer Conversion Notes;
 - EffectManager singleton for all attribute effects.
 	- EffectManager.register_effects(EffectRegistry) # EffectRegistry is a custom resource containing list of all effects
 - AttributeEffectSpec must be a Node. It will be replicated below Attributes.
 - AttributeContainer must have the tag property synced.

Need to research:
	- Can I disable multiplayer easily? Perhaps a bool & dynamically add a Synchronizer & Spawner if enabled at boot.

TODO Optimizations for current version:
	- Replace iterating by index w/ iterating array directly (DONE)
	- Disable Attribute processing if no effects are present (DONE)
