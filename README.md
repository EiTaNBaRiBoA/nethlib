## Proper Documentation is a TODO

### Current Status of Major Tools:
1. Attributes: Actively working on when I can. Current plans:
	1. Get it working for singleplayer.
	2. Write unit tests using GUT.
	3. Add multiplayer support.
2. JSON Serialization: Serialization of objects & types done, a seamless way to implement it is still TBD after I reach that point in my own game.
